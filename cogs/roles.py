        #What happened to the previous code??
        # A: We decided to use 'Cogs'. Essentially, cogs allow you to organize your code with classes.
        #    You will notice we now have a 'Roles.py' file that handles all the events in our 'Roles' class
        #    And, we also have a 'Schedules.py' file that handles all the events/commands in our 'Schedules' class
        #    Although you might see slight changes, don't worry. The same logic we've learned still applies!

        # TO DO: 
        # - Send a message in your #Get-Roles text channel
        # - Using 'on_raw_reaction_add' make another listener event that gives a member role depending on their 
        #   reaction to the message you sent in the #Get-Roles channel
            # (For example, if the user reacts to the message with the :acmDev: emoji, then that user
            # will be added to the 'Dev Member' Role.)
        # - There are three roles they can choose to join, 'Dev Member', 'Algo Member', and 'Create Member'.

        #Steps to do this:
        # 1) Store each role into a variable using 'discord.utils.get'
        # 2)Store the id of the designated #Get-Roles message into a variable
        # 3)Check if the payload message id matches the designated #Get-Roles message id
        # 4)If they do match, use if statements to handle each of the three possible reactions
        #   (Ex.If the emoji id equal's that of the :acmDev: emoji, give them the 'Dev Member' Role)
        # 5)Use the 'add_roles' function to add the member to a role 

        #TIPS/HINTS
        # - In order to get the id of a emoji, type/enter into a text channel "\[emoji_name_goes_here"
        # - For example, if the emoji's name was 'happy' you would type/enter into a text channel
        #   '\happy'
        # - 'on_raw_reaction_add' has a payload parameter make sure to look into it
        # - All of the functions I mentioned are explained in the Discord.py API Reference
